# Library Management System
This project was designed in response to a final assignment for a Python class. The project was made in the platform PyCharm. The assignment was to design an extensive original code. I designed a library management system.

This system begins with a menu 

Here is a list of functions:
* View entire collection
* Search by:
  * name
  * patron ID
  * partial queries
  * title
  * author
  * collection type
* Add, update, or delete records belonging to:
  * users
  * collections
* account for user error, reroute to menu
* Generate user reports:
  * check-out history
  * fines
* Return titles

The comprehensive project utilizes dictionaries and databases and CVS files to maximize functionality of the system.
